# NMS-SNc-atlas
NMS-SNc is a probabilistic atlas of Substantia Nigra pars compacta constructed using a 3T Neuromelanin sensitive MRI sequence (NMS-MRI) which is a T1-weighted high-resolution fast spin-echo sequence. NMS-MRI is highly sensitive to neuromelanin which is a by-product of dopaminergic neurons in SNc and therefore renders it as a hyper intense structure. This probabilistic atlas is constructed using manually delineated SNc ROIs of 27 subjects which were registered to MNI152_1mm template using ANTs software. The NMS-SNc probabilistic atlas benefits from the dopamine based neuromelanin contrast and facilitates a precise and standardised SNc localization, which is crucial for analysis of SNc related neuro pathological disorders. The detailed methodology and validation of this atlas is mentioned in the paper- 'Microstructural Abnormalities of Substantia Nigra in Parkinsonâ€™s disease: A Neuromelanin Sensitive MRI Atlas Based Study'
